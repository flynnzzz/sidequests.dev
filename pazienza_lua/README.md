## 3. notes
- My first multiple files lua project, this helped me familiarize with the language
- Implementing the game solver using recursion was very stimulating
- Digitalizing this card game and "achieving victory" this way was quite satisfying (considering the unlikeliness of winning
with actual physical cards).
